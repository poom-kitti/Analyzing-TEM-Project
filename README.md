# Analyzing TEM Project 

## What is the purpose of the project?
To formulate a plan to improve the user experience of submitting assignments in myCourseVille platform (https://www.mycourseville.com/).

## What is included in this repisitory?
* The code I used to clean up the data into a form that is better suited for Tableau
* Some simple data exploration to find any trend from the data received from the questionnaire

## Regarding the Data
The data is the data from a questionnaire sent to Chulalongkorn University Engineering students to rate the usability of myCourseVille in submitting assignments online
* There is 64 people who completed the questionnaire
* The questionnaire is separated into four parts/phases
  1. Signing up / Signing in
  2. Registering for course / Finding course
  3. Finding assignment
  4. Submitting assignment
* For each part, the user will need to rate three statements from a score of 1 to 5 depending on how strongly they agree with the statements (1 = strongly disagree & 5 = strongly agree)
  1. I thought the system was easy to use.
  2. I found the system very awkward to use.
  3. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
* The user will finally rate the overall sastisfactory of using the myCourseVille platform from a score of 1 to 10
